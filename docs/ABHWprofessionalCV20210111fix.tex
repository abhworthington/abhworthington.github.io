\cvitem{title}{\emph{MNCs, NTBs, and New Protectionism: Industrial Protection Coalitions in an Era of Global Capital}}
\cvitem{supervisors}{William R. Clark (TAMU), Andrew M. Kerner (UM), Iain G. Osgood (UM)}
\cvitem{description}{The dissertation explains the conditional rise of non-tariff protections as tariffs declined in postwar global economy.The core claim is that global capital flows created political incentives which changed the politics of protectionism in many countries. I advance a new typology of ``market access barriers'', an improvement over the existing tariff/NTM framing which clarifies, both empirically and theoretically, the effect of trade-distorting policies. From this, I develop a model of industrial coalitional politics in support of or opposition to different policy options. I present empirical support for hypothesized divergence across industries and countries in the nature of protection using a new dataset developed from the UNCTAD TRAINS database and other sources.}
