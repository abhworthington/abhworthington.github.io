				<p>I'm a <a href="http://fordschool.umich.edu/faculty/alton-worthington">lecturer 
					in stats computing and data visualization</a> at the 
					<a href="http://fordschool.umich.edu/">Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.</a>
					I completed my Ph.D in <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/polisci">Political Science</a> at 
					the <a href="https://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. (Go Blue.)</p>
				<p>My primary research interests are in the areas of comparative and international political 
					economy, but my general interest in social inquiry has led me to other projects 
					(both independent and collaborative) well outside that subfield.</p>
				<p>My dissertation project explained the shift in protectionist policies from tariffs 
					(and tariff-like policies) to other (non-tariff) measures in the postwar global 
					economy. In the dissertation, I advanced a new theory of the distributive consequences 
					of goods market-distorting measures (capturing both tariff and non-tariff measures) 
					and a theory of protectionist politics in light of those incentives. This research 
					is part of my longer-term research agenda linking the politics of capital mobility 
					to the politics of goods and services market liberalization.</p>
				<p>Yes, this website is still hopelessly out of date. I'm sorry. - ABHW, 2022-04-25
